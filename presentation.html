                <p>Safi is the home of internationally renowned surfing spots 
such as Ras Lafâa and Cap Bedouzza for Big Wave Surfing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In order to develop this surfing in Morocco, we would like 
to organize the 2nd edition of the Safi Surf Invitational by 
OCP in collaboration with The Royal Moroccan Surf and 
Bodyboard Federation and the Province of Safi on the 
legendary Rass el Lafaâ spot in Safi, now recognized as one 
of the best waves in the world</p>
            <br>
            <p>The event will take place over 3 days and 2 nights, with a 
waiting period running from February 1 to May 1, 2024, and 
will bring together the best Moroccan and International 
surfers and bodyboarders</p>
            <br>
            <p>Program: Surf and bodyboard contest, Night surfing 
experience, exhibitions, workshops, surfing lessons for 
orphans, beach clean-up, street art, music, and a closing 
ceremony attended by the highest authorities in Saf</p>
            <br>
            <p>Through this unique project, which aims to promote the 
potential of surfing in Morocco and Safi, while supporting 
the town’s tourism development, we hope to organize an 
event that reflects the Moroccan values</p>
